                Overview of IT Industry

1. What is software? What is software engineering?
Software is a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do. Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software to ensure it's  reliabe and efficient.

 2. Explain types of software le and efficient.
System Software: Manages hardware and provides basic functionalities (e.g., operating systems).
Application Software: Helps users perform tasks (e.g., word processors, web browsers).
Programming Software: Tools to create software (e.g., compilers, debuggers).




















3. What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC.
SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a process used to develop software It has  6  phases:

Requirements Gathering: Gathering and documenting what the software should do.
Design: Creating a blueprint of how the software will be structured and function.
Implementation: Writing the code and building the software.
Testing: Checking if the software works correctly.
Deployment: Releasing the software for users.
Maintenance: Updating and fixing issues in the software after release.
